>> clean up and reorganize your code
>> wire up your project with optuna and wandb
>> work methodology:
1. set up vanilla cnn model (change your current)
2. use k-fold to train your model
3. log your loss\metric per label while training, check direction of error
>> create figures:
1. error vs epoch per labels (check interesting points - edges etc)
2. mean error vs epoch for all labels
>> try different loss:
1. one output: 0 to 720 non-cyclic
2. with simple cyclic: min(L1 norm, 720 - L1 norm)
3. [sin, cos] cyclic (is it better?)
